# Decision-Tree-Classifier

<li>A decision tree is a tool that uses a tree-like model set of decisions that lead the user to the answer. Decision trees are commonly used in operations research, specifically in decision analysis, to help identify a strategy most likely to reach a goal.
<li>This repository demonstrates how to implement a decision tree classifier. It includes model training, testing, accuracy evaluation, and visualization.

VISUALIZATION
<LI>The decision tree structure can be visualized to interpret how decisions are made.
<LI>Insights from the tree can help improve interpretability and optimize the model.
